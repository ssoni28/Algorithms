/**
 *
 * 
 * PreFlow:
 * 1) 0 <= f(e) <= c(e)
 * 2) For all V, Sum (f(e)) incoming >= Sum (f(e)) outgoing : Preflow 
 *    Hence, flow is maximum when Sum (f(e)) incoming = Sum (f(e)) outgoing
 * 3) e f(v) = Sum (f(e)) incoming - Sum (f(e)) outgoing : Excess
 * 4) h(v) >= 0, Height of each vertex
 * 5) A s-t preflow f and labeling h are compatible if:
 *      i)   h(t) = 0
 *      ii)  h(s) = n (Number of nodes)
 *      iii) For all (v,w) in Ef (in the residual graph) h(v) <= h(w) + 1 
 * 6) If f is an s-t preflow and h is compatible with f then there is no s-t path in Gf ie residual graph
 * 7) Functions:
 *    push (f,h,v,w)
 *      if ef(v) > 0 and h(w) < h(v) and (v,w) is a residual edge      //if v has excess get rid of the excess
 *          Two cases:
 *          1.  E(v,w) is a forward edge:
 *                  df = min ( ef(v) , c(e) - f(e) )   // push out entrie excess or the amt that is there whichever is smaller
 *                  increase f(e) by df
 *          2. E(v,w) is a backward edge:
 *                  df = min ( ef(v) , f(e) )
 *                  decrease f(e) by df
 *      return (f,h)
 * 
 * 
 *    relabel(f,h,v)
 *      if ef(v) > 0 and for all (v,w) in Ef h(w) >= h(v)
 *          h(v) = h(v) + 1
 *      return (f,h)
 * 8) Algorithm:
 *      Initialize h(v) = 0 for all v != s
 *                 h(s) = n
 *                 f(e) = c(e) , for any e = (s,v)
 *                 f(e) = 0    , otherwise
 *      while there exists v != t such that ef(v) > 0      // Node has excess
 *          if there exists a w such that push(f,h,v,w) is possible
 *              push(f,h,v,w)
 *          else
 *              relabel(f,h,v)
 *      return f
 * 
 * In short any node that as excess try to do something about it. Either push ahead or behind 
 * OR
 * relabel if you cant push it anywhere
